# Kubus test suite

All automated tests live in this workspace package (`@kubus/tests`): Vitest
unit suites for shared, server, and client code plus a Playwright end-to-end
suite that drives the built app against a real kind cluster. Coverage scans
all TypeScript production packages, including Electron, so untested files are
counted instead of disappearing from the report.

## Layout

```
tests/
  unit/
    shared/   # shared/src — jsonpath, resource metadata, ws protocol schemas
    server/   # server/src — kube logic, helm, watch/delta engine, ws handlers
    client/   # client/src — smart filter, display helpers, stores, hooks (jsdom)
  e2e/
    specs/        # Playwright specs
    fixtures/     # workloads applied to the cluster (namespace kubus-e2e)
    helpers/      # kubeconfig/cluster plumbing shared by setup + webServer
    global-setup.ts
    start-server.mjs  # webServer entry: seeds isolated state, boots server/dist
  setup/client.ts     # jsdom shims + jest-dom for the client project
  vitest.config.ts    # three projects: shared, server, client
  playwright.config.ts
```

## Unit tests

```bash
pnpm test              # from the repo root (or `pnpm test` inside tests/)
pnpm test:watch
pnpm test:coverage     # writes tests/coverage/
```

Coverage is rooted at the repository rather than this package. The report
therefore includes unimported production files from `shared/src`, `server/src`,
`client/src`, and `electron/src`. A 50% floor on every repository-wide metric
protects the current baseline; per-package floors keep improvements in one
package from hiding regressions in another. Electron is deliberately visible
at 0% until desktop main/preload tests are added.

No build step needed: tests import package TypeScript sources directly, and
`@kubus/shared` is aliased to `shared/src`. Server/shared tests run in node,
client tests in jsdom (Testing Library is set up; `tests/setup/client.ts`
shims `matchMedia`/`ResizeObserver`).

Server tests fake the cluster at the `ClusterHandle` seam — pass
`{ clusters: { get: () => fakeHandle } }` as the `AppContext` and implement
only what the code under test touches (see `logs-socket.test.ts`,
`watcher.test.ts`).

## End-to-end tests

```bash
pnpm build             # client + server dist must exist
pnpm test:e2e          # from the repo root
```

Requirements: a kind cluster named `kubus-a` (`hack/dev-clusters.sh` creates
it; override with `KUBUS_E2E_KIND_CLUSTER`), `kubectl`, and either system
Chrome or `PLAYWRIGHT_CHANNEL=chromium` after `playwright install chromium`.

What a run does:

1. `start-server.mjs` writes `e2e/.state/kubeconfig` (the kind cluster plus an
   unreachable `kubus-ghost` context for error-state tests), wipes the
   isolated `XDG_CONFIG_HOME`, and boots `server/dist` on port 3399 with the
   token fixed to `dev` — your real kubeconfig and settings are never touched.
2. `global-setup.ts` applies `fixtures/e2e-workloads.yaml` into the
   `kubus-e2e` namespace (idempotent) and waits for rollout: an nginx
   deployment, a service, config/secret objects, a pod that logs a numbered
   line every 2s, and a crash-looping pod. Mutation specs restore fixture
   values in teardown so later tests see the original state.
3. Specs run serially (`workers: 1` — the server's settings/kubeconfig state
   is global) against `http://127.0.0.1:3399`.

Failures keep traces/screenshots under `e2e/.results/`; open a trace with
`pnpm exec playwright show-trace <trace.zip>`.

Cleanup (optional): `kubectl --context kind-kubus-a delete namespace kubus-e2e`.

Selector conventions: production builds strip `data-testid`, so locate by
role/text/placeholder. Grids virtualize rows — filter via the search box
instead of scrolling. With nested MUI dialogs, background elements go
aria-hidden; scope queries to the dialog by text.

## CI

The `build` matrix job runs the unit suites on every OS. Linux runs the
repository-wide coverage command, enforces its thresholds, and uploads the
HTML report; macOS and Windows run the faster unit command. The `e2e` job
builds the web surface, creates a kind cluster named `kubus-a` via
`helm/kind-action`, and runs the Playwright suite, uploading traces on failure.
